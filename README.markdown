# Group Forum

This is a bit of glue to link reader groups to forums. 

As with group pages, it imposes the rule that a forum with any group associations is only visible to members of those groups.

## Status

Very simple, minimally tested, should just work.

## Bugs and comments

In [lighthouse](http://spanner.lighthouseapp.com/projects/26912-radiant-extensions), please, or for little things an email or github message is always welcome.
